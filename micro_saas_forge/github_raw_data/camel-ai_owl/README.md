# 🛠️ Installation

## **Prerequisites**

### Install Python

Before installing OWL, ensure you have Python installed (version 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12 is supported):

> **Note for GAIA Benchmark Users**: When running the GAIA benchmark evaluation, please use the `gaia58.18` branch which includes a customized version of the CAMEL framework in the `owl/camel` directory. This version contains enhanced toolkits with improved stability specifically optimized for the GAIA benchmark compared to the standard CAMEL installation.

```bash
# Check if Python is installed
python --version

# If not installed, download and install from https://www.python.org/downloads/
# For macOS users with Homebrew:
brew install python@3.10

# For Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.10 python3.10-venv python3-pip
```

## **Installation Options**

OWL supports multiple installation methods to fit your workflow preferences.

### Option 1: Using uv (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone github repo
git clone https://github.com/camel-ai/owl.git

# Change directory into project directory
cd owl

# Install uv if you don't have it already
pip install uv

# Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
uv venv .venv --python=3.10

# Activate the virtual environment
# For macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# For Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install CAMEL with all dependencies
uv pip install -e .
```

### Option 2: Using venv and pip

```bash
# Clone github repo
git clone https://github.com/camel-ai/owl.git

# Change directory into project directory
cd owl

# Create a virtual environment
# For Python 3.10 (also works with 3.11, 3.12)
python3.10 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# For macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# For Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt --use-pep517
```

### Option 3: Using conda

```bash
# Clone github repo
git clone https://github.com/camel-ai/owl.git

# Change directory into project directory
cd owl

# Create a conda environment
conda create -n owl python=3.10

# Activate the conda environment
conda activate owl

# Option 1: Install as a package (recommended)
pip install -e .

# Option 2: Install from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt --use-pep517
```

### Option 4: Using Docker

#### **Using Pre-built Image (Recommended)**

```bash
# This option downloads a ready-to-use image from Docker Hub
# Fastest and recommended for most users
docker compose up -d

# Run OWL inside the container
docker compose exec owl bash
cd .. && source .venv/bin/activate
playwright install-deps
xvfb-python examples/run.py
```

#### **Building Image Locally**

```bash
# For users who need to customize the Docker image or cannot access Docker Hub:
# 1. Open docker-compose.yml
# 2. Comment out the "image: mugglejinx/owl:latest" line
# 3. Uncomment the "build:" section and its nested properties
# 4. Then run:
docker compose up -d --build

# Run OWL inside the container
docker compose exec owl bash
cd .. && source .venv/bin/activate
playwright install-deps
xvfb-python examples/run.py
```

#### **Using Convenience Scripts**

```bash
# Navigate to container directory
cd .container

# Make the script executable and build the Docker image
chmod +x build_docker.sh
./build_docker.sh

# Run OWL with your question
./run_in_docker.sh "your question"
```

## **Setup Environment Variables**

OWL requires various API keys to interact with different services.

### Setting Environment Variables Directly

You can set environment variables directly in your terminal:

- **macOS/Linux (Bash/Zsh)**:

  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
  # Add other required API keys as needed
  ```

- **Windows (Command Prompt)**:

  ```batch
  set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
  ```

- **Windows (PowerShell)**:
  ```powershell
  $env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-api-key-here"
  ```

> **Note**: Environment variables set directly in the terminal will only persist for the current session.

### Alternative: Using a `.env` File

If you prefer using a `.env` file instead, you can:

1. **Copy and Rename the Template**:

   ```bash
   # For macOS/Linux
   cd owl
   cp .env_template .env

   # For Windows
   cd owl
   copy .env_template .env
   ```

   Alternatively, you can manually create a new file named `.env` in the owl directory and copy the contents from `.env_template`.

2. **Configure Your API Keys**:
   Open the `.env` file in your preferred text editor and insert your API keys in the corresponding fields.

> **Note**: For the minimal example (`examples/run_mini.py`), you only need to configure the LLM API key (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`).

### **MCP Desktop Commander Setup**

If using MCP Desktop Commander within Docker, run:

```bash
npx -y @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander setup --force-file-protocol
```

For more detailed Docker usage instructions, including cross-platform support, optimized configurations, and troubleshooting, please refer to [DOCKER_README.md](.container/DOCKER_README_en.md).

# 🚀 Quick Start

## Basic Usage

After installation and setting up your environment variables, you can start using OWL right away:

```bash
python examples/run.py
```

## Running with Different Models

### Model Requirements

- **Tool Calling**: OWL requires models with robust tool calling capabilities to interact with various toolkits. Models must be able to understand tool descriptions, generate appropriate tool calls, and process tool outputs.

- **Multimodal Understanding**: For tasks involving web interaction, image analysis, or video processing, models with multimodal capabilities are required to interpret visual content and context.

#### Supported Models

For information on configuring AI models, please refer to our [CAMEL models documentation](https://docs.camel-ai.org/key_modules/models.html#supported-model-platforms-in-camel).

> **Note**: For optimal performance, we strongly recommend using OpenAI models (GPT-4 or later versions). Our experiments show that other models may result in significantly lower performance on complex tasks and benchmarks, especially those requiring advanced multi-modal understanding and tool use.

OWL supports various LLM backends, though capabilities may vary depending on the model's tool calling and multimodal abilities. You can use the following scripts to run with different models:

```bash
# Run with Claude model
python examples/run_claude.py

# Run with Qwen model
python examples/run_qwen_zh.py

# Run with Deepseek model
python examples/run_deepseek_zh.py

# Run with other OpenAI-compatible models
python examples/run_openai_compatible_model.py

# Run with Gemini model
python examples/run_gemini.py

# Run with Azure OpenAI
python examples/run_azure_openai.py

# Run with Ollama
python examples/run_ollama.py
```

For a simpler version that only requires an LLM API key, you can try our minimal example:

```bash
python examples/run_mini.py
```

You can run OWL agent with your own task by modifying the `examples/run.py` script:

```python
# Define your own task
task = "Task description here."

society = construct_society(question)
answer, chat_history, token_count = run_society(society)

print(f"\033[94mAnswer: {answer}\033[0m")
```

For uploading files, simply provide the file path along with your question:

```python
# Task with a local file (e.g., file path: `tmp/example.docx`)
task = "What is in the given DOCX file? Here is the file path: tmp/example.docx"

society = construct_society(question)
answer, chat_history, token_count = run_society(society)
print(f"\033[94mAnswer: {answer}\033[0m")
```

OWL will then automatically invoke document-related tools to process the file and extract the answer.

### Example Tasks

Here are some tasks you can try with OWL:

- "Find the latest stock price for Apple Inc."
- "Analyze the sentiment of recent tweets about climate change"
- "Help me debug this Python code: [your code here]"
- "Summarize the main points from this research paper: [paper URL]"
- "Create a data visualization for this dataset: [dataset path]"

# 🧰 Toolkits and Capabilities

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

OWL's MCP integration provides a standardized way for AI models to interact with various tools and data sources:

Before using MCP, you need to install Node.js first.

### **Install Node.js**

### Windows

Download the official installer: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

Check "Add to PATH" option during installation.

### Linux

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm -y
```

### Mac
